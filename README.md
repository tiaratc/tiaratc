🚀 About Me

Hi there! I’m Tiara Cahyadi, a student at Purwadhika Digital Technology School, based in Jakarta, Indonesia. With a unique background in the music events and food industries, I am now transitioning into the world of Data Science and Machine Learning.

This GitHub showcases projects I’ve developed during my studies—I’m just three months into programming, so I’m learning as I go! 😊

I’d love to hear your feedback, advice, or opportunities for collaboration to support my growth in this exciting new field.

When I’m not analyzing data or coding, I enjoy watching reality shows, exploring trends in sustainable food, and playing the piano 🎹.
