# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🌟🎵

## Tiara Cahyadi  
**Data Analyst | Data Scientist**  

Hi there! I'm Tiara, a student at **Purwadhika Digital Technology School**, based in Jakarta, Indonesia.  
I’m transitioning into the field of **Data Science and Machine Learning**, with a unique background in the music events and food industries.  

This GitHub showcases projects I’ve developed during my studies—**I’m just three months into programming, so I’m learning as I go!** 😊

I’d love to hear your feedback, advice, or opportunities for collaboration to support my growth in this exciting new field.

When I’m not analyzing data or coding, I enjoy watching reality shows, exploring trends in sustainable food, and playing the piano 🎹.

Feel free to connect, give feedback, or collaborate on my projects! 😊
